## Fixed Issues

The webpage I fixed had a list of notable issues. The entire HTML was constructed with <div> elements. I swapped out many if not all of the <div> elements for more semantic HTML elemetns such as <header>, <section>. <nav>, <article> and <footer>. I then worked through the document to identify issues that did not meet accessibility standards by adding an <alt> element to the <img> elements and <title> for the <img> element located in the style.css file. i also applied the <id> element to resolve the issue with the link in the header to the "search engine optimization".

The best way I have found to test the site is to download the Chrome "Screen Reader" extension to test accessibility
